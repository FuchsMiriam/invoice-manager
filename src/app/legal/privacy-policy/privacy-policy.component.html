      <h2>3. General Notes and Mandatory Information</h2>

      <div>
        <h3>Data Protection</h3>
        <p>
          The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
          very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
          accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this
          privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use this website, various pieces of personal data are
          collected. Personal data is any data with which you can be personally
          identified. This privacy policy explains which data we collect and
          what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this
          happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g.
          communication by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of
          the data against access by third parties is not possible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Notice Concerning the Responsible Party</h3>
        <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>

        <p>
          Miriam Fuchs<br />
          Beethovenstraße 47<br />
          65232 Taunusstein<br />
          Phone: [Phone number of the responsible party]<br />
          Email: info&#0064;miriam-fuchs.net
        </p>

        <p>
          The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or
          jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing
          personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
        <p>
          Unless a more specific storage period is stated within this privacy
          policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for
          the data processing ceases to apply. If you assert a legitimate
          request for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data
          will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for
          storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention
          periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these
          reasons cease to apply.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal
          data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special data
          categories under Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit
          consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data
          processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented
          to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device
          (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also based on §
          25(1) TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your data is required to fulfill a contract or for pre-contractual
          measures, we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
          Furthermore, we process your data if required to fulfill a legal
          obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be
          based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The
          respective legal bases are explained in this privacy policy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
          consent. You can revoke consent already given at any time. The
          legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation
          remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>
          Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct
          Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
          IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE
          RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT, FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR
          SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES
          TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON
          WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA
          UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING
          THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING
          SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION
          PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU
          HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
          DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING
          TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU
          OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING
          PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>
          Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the event of breaches of the GDPR, affected persons have the right
          to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the
          Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of
          the alleged breach. The right to lodge a complaint exists without
          prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on
          your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to yourself
          or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
          request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will
          only be done to the extent technically feasible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Right to Access, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
          right at any time to free access to your stored personal data, its
          origin and recipient, and the purpose of the data processing and, if
          applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this
          purpose and for further questions on the topic of personal data, you
          can contact us at any time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
          your personal data. For this, you can contact us at any time. The
          right to restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
            usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the
            verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the
            processing of your personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can
            request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it to
            exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to
            request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
            instead of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a
            balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as
            it is not yet determined whose interests prevail, you have the right
            to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data
          – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or
          for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to protect
          the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of
          important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

        <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
        <p>
          This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to
          protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or
          inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an
          encrypted connection by the browser's address line switching from
          "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us
          cannot be read by third parties.

      <div>
        <h3>Contact Form</h3>
        <p>
          If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the
          inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will
          be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case
          of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your
          consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
          request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary
          for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases,
          the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective
          handling of the inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on
          your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if requested; the consent can be
          revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you
          request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for
          data storage ceases (e.g., after completion of your request).
          Mandatory legal provisions – especially retention periods – remain
          unaffected.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Inquiry by Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your inquiry including all
          resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed
          by us for the purpose of handling your request. We do not pass on this
          data without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
          request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary
          for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases,
          the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective
          handling of the inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          The data you send to us via contact inquiries will remain with us
          until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the
          purpose for data storage ceases (e.g., after completion of your
          request). Mandatory legal provisions – especially legal retention
          periods – remain unaffected.
